## What's a turmite?
A turmite is a Turing machine that has an orientation in addition to a current state and an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells.

Based on a prewritten set of rules, turmite colors the tiles of a grid, which gives us an amazing result!

## Usage 
Type in an instructions and press the **Let's go** button. That's it!

## Syntax
Each input line should contain five symbols that define the current state and tile color, updated state, and new tile color with direction correspondingly.

For example, line **A 0 B 1 R** means that if the current state is **A** and the color of a tile underneath is **0** then the next state will be **B** with the tile recolored in **1**. Then the turmite will move rightwards (relatively to his previous direction).
