## Definition of a turmite
A turmite is a type of Turing machine that possesses both an orientation and an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells in addition to its current state. 

By following a set of predetermined rules, a turmite can color the tiles of a grid to produce intricate and visually striking patterns.

## Usage 
To use the turmite, simply input your instructions and press the **Let's go** button.


## Syntax
In terms of syntax, each input line should consist of five symbols that represent the current state and color of the tile, the updated state, the new color of the tile, and the direction of movement for the turmite. 

For example, the line **A 0 B 1 R** indicates that if the current state is **A** and the tile underneath is colored **0**, the next state will be **B** with the tile recolored to **1**. The turmite will then move rightward relative to its previous direction.
